### Description
Journal Buddy is here to help you meet your journaling needs and goals. Use Journal Buddy to make entries that recount your challenges, capture your ideas, and note the things you're thankful for in Journal Buddy's easy to use, distraction-free interface. Journaling is most helpful if it's done regularly. Use Journal Buddy's metrics to find out what days of the week you are most likely to journal and see counts of your entries by month or days of the week.
